Hi, I’m Shivaprasad Patil, Associate Director of Bioinformatics – Predictive AI, with a deep passion for transforming drug discovery and precision medicine through the power of data and AI. With over a decade of experience, I specialize in leveraging clinical and genomics data using advanced machine learning and computational biology techniques.

My core expertise lies in multi-omics data integration across diverse platforms — including bulk, single-cell, and spatial genomics; imaging modalities like Cell Painting and immunofluorescence; and clinical datasets such as EHRs, disease registries, and IHC. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional environments, driving biomarker discovery and translational insights that push therapeutics forward through the development pipeline.


Featured Projects
======

### [BulkRNA-Agent: AI-Powered Transcriptomics Analysis](https://github.com/shivaprasad-patil/BulkRNA-Agent)
Open-source AI tool combining dual LLM architecture (reasoning + biomedical models) for intelligent bulk RNA-seq analysis. Features AI-powered design suggestions, interactive visualizations, and 100% local processing for data privacy. Streamlines the entire pipeline from QC to differential expression and enrichment analysis in one intuitive web interface.

### [ScAdver: Adversarial Batch Correction for Single-Cell Data](https://github.com/shivaprasad-patil/ScAdver)
Python package that performs adversarial batch correction for single-cell RNA-seq data, eliminating technical batch effects while preserving biological variation and cell type identity. The framework features a train-once, project-forever paradigm—train on reference data, then rapidly transform unlimited query batches without retraining. For challenging scenarios with large protocol shifts (e.g., 10X → Smart-seq2), advanced domain adaptation via residual adapters enables robust cross-technology integration while maintaining biological fidelity.

### [MultiOmicsBind: Deep Learning for Multi-Omics Integration](https://github.com/shivaprasad-patil/MultiOmicsBind)
Deep learning framework that brings ImageBind's revolutionary binding modality concept to multi-omics data integration. Enables seamless integration of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data for comprehensive biological insights.
