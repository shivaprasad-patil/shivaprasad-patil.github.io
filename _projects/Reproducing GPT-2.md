🧠💬 ChatGPT has become an integral part of my daily life. I became increasingly intrigued to understand what was going on *under the hood* of the GPT model and spent my weekends 🛠️ building a GPT model — aiming to replicate OpenAI’s GPT-2 (124M) model.

🎓📚 **Andrej Karpathy’s** lecture series is hands-down the best resource to learn about **Deep Learning** and **LLMs**.

🚀 After a lot of tinkering, I finally completed building my GPT model and began training it on a piece of internet data. This whole journey made me appreciate even more the **incredible ingenuity** and **exceptional engineering** that goes into OpenAI’s models. 🙌

🤖 I'm eagerly awaiting the launch of OpenAI’s **open-source reasoning model**, and now that I’ve got a better grasp of how LLMs work, I’m *super excited* to start applying them in my projects! 🔍⚙️
