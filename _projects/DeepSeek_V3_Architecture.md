# DeepSeek-V3 Model Architecture: Educational Deep Dive

## Overview
This notebook provides an educational exploration of the DeepSeek-V3 transformer architecture breaking down each component with visualizations and examples using randomly generated data to understand how the model works under the hood.

1. **Model Architecture Overview** - High-level structure
2. **Attention Mechanisms** - Multi-head and grouped-query attention
3. **Feed-Forward Networks** - MLP layers and activations
4. **Layer Normalization** - RMSNorm implementation
5. **Positional Encodings** - RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)
6. **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** - Expert routing and selection
7. **Model Scaling** - Different model sizes (16B, 236B, 671B)
8. **Inference Pipeline** - How text generation works

This notebook is for:
- ðŸ“– **Educational demonstrations** of DeepSeek-V3 Model Architecture.
