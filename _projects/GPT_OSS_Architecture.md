# GPT-OSS: Architecture Implementation

This comprehensive Jupyter notebook provides a **hands-on, implementation-focused** on exploration of the GPT-OSS (Open Source) model architecture. It builds working components and integrates them into a complete model.

### 🛠️ **Hands-On Implementation**
- **Working code** for all major GPT-OSS components
- **Live demonstrations** showing tensor operations
- **Performance comparisons** between architectures
- **Complete model integration** with error-free execution
- **Interactive visualizations** of attention patterns and expert usage

## 📋 Table of Contents
1. [🏗️ Core Architecture Components](#architecture) - Build RMSNorm, RoPE, Attention, MLP blocks
2. [🔤 Advanced Tokenization](#tokenizer) - o200k encoding with conversation tokens  
3. [🧠 Model Integration](#integration) - Complete GPT-OSS vs GPT-2 comparison
4. [📊 Training & Scaling Analysis](#training) - Memory, compute, and performance insights

## 🚀 **GPT-OSS Architecture Highlights**

This notebook implements and demonstrates:

- **🎭 Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: 8 experts with 2 active per token (4x capacity, 25% compute)
- **🔍 Grouped Query Attention (GQA)**: 4:1 query-to-key ratio for memory efficiency  
- **🌀 Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)**: Relative positions without learned parameters
- **📏 RMS Normalization**: Simpler, more stable than LayerNorm
- **🪟 Sliding Window Attention**: Efficient long-context processing
- **🔧 Advanced Tokenization**: 200k+ vocabulary with special conversation tokens

## ✨ **Unique Features of This Notebook**

✅ **Interactive demonstrations** - See tensors flow through each component  
✅ **Error-free integration** - Complete working model implementation  
✅ **Visual comparisons** - Charts showing benefits of each innovation  
✅ **Educational focus** - Clear explanations with working example  

Let's dive in and build some cutting-edge AI architecture! 🧠💻

This notebook is for:
